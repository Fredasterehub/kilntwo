## Prompt: Create `assets/protocol.md` — KilnTwo Behavioral Protocol Block

### Context

You are creating a static Markdown asset file for KilnTwo, a multi-model pipeline
orchestrator Node.js CLI tool located at `/DEV/kilntwo/`.

Read the following files before writing anything:

- `/DEV/kilntwo/package.json` — project metadata (name: `kilntwo`, version: `0.1.0`,
  description: "Lightweight Claude Code development protocol — multi-model pipeline
  orchestrator (Claude Opus 4.6 + GPT-5.2/5.3 via Codex CLI)")
- `/DEV/kilntwo/src/install.js` — shows exactly how `assets/protocol.md` is consumed:
  it is read with `fs.readFileSync(protocolSrc, 'utf8')` and passed to `insertProtocol(claudeMdPath, protocolContent)`
- `/DEV/kilntwo/src/markers.js` — shows how the protocol block is wrapped: it is
  inserted between `<!-- kilntwo:protocol:begin vX.Y.Z -->` and
  `<!-- kilntwo:protocol:end -->` markers in the target CLAUDE.md; the content of
  `protocol.md` is the inner body between those markers (do not include the markers
  themselves in the file)
- `/DEV/kilntwo/src/paths.js` — exports `resolvePaths`, `projectMemoryDir`,
  `projectClaudeMd`; understand that `projectMemoryDir` resolves to
  `<home>/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-path>/memory`

The `assets/` directory exists at `/DEV/kilntwo/assets/`. It currently contains
subdirectories `agents/`, `commands/`, and `templates/`. You are creating
`assets/protocol.md` directly inside the `assets/` directory (not in a subdirectory).

### Task

Create `/DEV/kilntwo/assets/protocol.md` — a Markdown document that serves as the
behavioral protocol block inserted into a project's CLAUDE.md when KilnTwo is
installed. This block defines the rules the Claude Code orchestrator must follow
when the KilnTwo pipeline is active.

### Files to Create

- `/DEV/kilntwo/assets/protocol.md`

Do not create any other files. Do not modify any existing files.

---

### Specification

The file is pure Markdown. It has no YAML frontmatter, no HTML comments, no
`<!-- kilntwo:protocol:begin -->` or `<!-- kilntwo:protocol:end -->` markers —
those are added by `src/markers.js` automatically. Write only the inner content.

The file must contain all six sections below, using `##` headings, in exactly
the order listed.

---

#### Section 1 — Heading and Preamble

The file must open with the heading:

```
# KilnTwo Orchestration Protocol
```

Immediately below the heading, write a single introductory paragraph (2–3 sentences)
stating:

- This protocol is active when KilnTwo is installed in the project.
- The Claude Code orchestrator must follow these rules exactly.
- Rules are enforced across all five pipeline stages.

---

#### Section 2 — `## Pipeline Stages`

Describe the five stages as a numbered list. Each stage entry must include:
- A bold stage title
- A parenthetical indicating whether the stage is interactive or automated
- A concise description of what happens in the stage (2–4 sentences)

The five stages in order:

**Stage 1 — Initialization & Brainstorm** (interactive)

The operator interactively describes the project goal. The orchestrator asks
clarifying questions until it has a clear picture of scope, constraints, and
success criteria. Memory checkpoints are written periodically: vision.md captures
the project goal, and MEMORY.md is updated with stage/phase/status/timestamp.
The stage ends when the operator explicitly signals readiness to move to planning.

**Stage 2 — Planning** (automated with operator review)

The orchestrator spawns both `kw-planner-claude` and a Codex planner in parallel
to produce independent implementation plans. A `kw-debater` agent then analyzes
disagreements between the two plans (debate mode 2 by default unless the operator
specified otherwise during Stage 1). A `kw-synthesizer` agent merges the plans
and debate resolution into a single `master-plan.md`. The operator reviews and
approves the master plan before Stage 3 begins.

**Stage 3 — Execution** (automated, phase by phase)

The orchestrator executes the master plan one phase at a time using the phase
executor pattern. Each phase consists of: generating a phase-scoped plan
(`.kw/plans/phase_plan.md`), generating per-task prompts (`.kw/prompts/`), running
each Codex task sequentially, and running up to 3 QA review rounds before merging.
Phases run sequentially; the orchestrator does not begin a new phase until the
prior phase is merged and MEMORY.md is updated.

**Stage 4 — Validation** (automated)

After all phases are complete, the orchestrator runs end-to-end validation. Results
are written to `.kw/validation/report.md`. Any missing credentials or environment
variables that blocked tests are recorded in `.kw/validation/missing_credentials.md`.
If validation fails, the orchestrator identifies the failing phase and re-enters
Stage 3 for that phase only.

**Stage 5 — Delivery** (interactive)

The orchestrator produces a final delivery summary for the operator covering: all
phases completed, files created or modified, test results, and any known limitations.
MEMORY.md is updated with `status: complete`. The operator is prompted to review
and approve the delivery.

---

#### Section 3 — `## Orchestration Rules`

Write each rule as a numbered list item. Use bold for the rule name, followed by
a colon and the rule body. Include all nine rules below in this exact order:

1. **No /compact** — Never use `/compact`. Context management is handled exclusively
   through session resets and memory file resumption. Compacting loses tool call
   history that may be needed for debugging.

2. **Memory files are the single source of truth** — `MEMORY.md`, `vision.md`,
   `master-plan.md`, `decisions.md`, and `pitfalls.md` define project state. Before
   starting any stage or phase, read these files. After completing any stage or phase,
   update `MEMORY.md` with the current stage, phase, status, and a brief handoff note.

3. **Sub-agent spawning is restricted** — Sub-agents cannot spawn their own
   sub-agents. Only the phase executor (the top-level orchestrator running Stage 3)
   may spawn Codex task agents. If a sub-agent needs additional work done, it must
   return that request to the orchestrator rather than spawning independently.

4. **Phase sizing** — Each phase must represent 1–4 hours of implementation work.
   Phases that are too large must be split during the planning stage. Phases that
   are too small may be merged. The synthesizer is responsible for enforcing this
   during master plan creation.

5. **QA cap** — A maximum of 3 review rounds are allowed per phase. If a phase
   still fails after 3 rounds, the orchestrator must stop automated execution and
   escalate to the operator with a summary of what failed and why.

6. **Debate mode default** — Unless the operator explicitly specifies a debate mode
   during Stage 1, the debater agent runs in mode 2 (Focused). Mode 1 (Skip) and
   mode 3 (Full) must be explicitly requested.

7. **Git discipline** — Create a feature branch at the start of each phase named
   `kw/phase-NN` where NN is the zero-padded phase number. Commit atomically after
   each task completes. Merge the phase branch to the main branch only after the
   phase passes QA. Never commit directly to the main branch during automated
   execution.

8. **No judgment calls during automated execution** — If the orchestrator encounters
   an ambiguous situation, a missing requirement, a conflicting instruction, or an
   unexpected error during Stage 3, it must stop and ask the operator rather than
   guessing. Automated execution resumes only after the operator provides direction.

9. **Generous timeouts** — All Codex CLI invocations must use a minimum timeout of
   600 seconds. Tasks that involve large codebases, complex reasoning, or file-heavy
   operations should use 900 seconds or more. Never invoke Codex with default or
   short timeouts during automated pipeline execution.

---

#### Section 4 — `## Codex CLI Reference`

Write a brief introductory sentence stating these are the canonical invocation
patterns for all Codex calls made by the orchestrator.

Then provide two labeled code blocks.

**Planning invocations** — label with a sentence: "Use this pattern when invoking
GPT-5.2 for planning, research, or prompt generation tasks:"

```bash
codex exec -m gpt-5.2 \
  -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  -C <project-path> \
  "<prompt-text>" \
  -o <output-file>
```

**Implementation invocations** — label with a sentence: "Use this pattern when
invoking gpt-5.3-codex for code implementation tasks:"

```bash
cat <prompt-file> | codex exec -m gpt-5.3-codex \
  -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' \
  --full-auto \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  -C <project-path> \
  - \
  -o <output-file>
```

After the two code blocks, write a bulleted list of three mandatory flags that
must always be present in every Codex invocation:

- `--skip-git-repo-check` — always include; prevents Codex from failing when the
  working directory is not a git repo root
- `-o <output-file>` — always capture output to a file; never discard Codex output
- `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'` — always set reasoning effort to high; default
  effort produces insufficient output quality for pipeline tasks

---

#### Section 5 — `## Memory Structure`

Write an introductory sentence stating that all memory files live in the project
memory directory resolved by KilnTwo, and that the orchestrator must read all
existing memory files at the start of every session before taking any action.

Then describe each memory file as a definition list (using the `**filename** —
description` pattern). Include all five files:

- **MEMORY.md** — Tracks the current pipeline state. Must always contain: `stage`
  (1–5), `phase` (phase number or "N/A"), `status` (one of: `active`, `paused`,
  `blocked`, `complete`), `timestamp` (ISO-8601), and a `handoff_notes` section
  with a plain-text description of what was last completed and what comes next.

- **vision.md** — Captures the project vision, goals, success criteria, and operator
  constraints as established during Stage 1. This file is written once during
  Stage 1 and read by both planners during Stage 2. It may be amended by the
  operator between stages but must not be modified by automated execution.

- **master-plan.md** — The synthesized master plan produced by `kw-synthesizer`
  at the end of Stage 2. Contains all phases with their tasks, acceptance criteria,
  and dependency graph. This is the authoritative execution plan for Stage 3.

- **decisions.md** — An append-only log of key technical decisions made during
  the pipeline, each with a rationale and the stage/phase in which it was made.
  Codex agents append to this file when they make architectural choices that affect
  future phases.

- **pitfalls.md** — An append-only log of problems encountered, failed approaches,
  and lessons learned during execution. Agents append to this file when they hit
  unexpected errors or discover that a planned approach will not work.

---

#### Section 6 — `## Working Directory Structure`

Write an introductory sentence stating that KilnTwo uses a `.kw/` directory at the
project root to store all pipeline artifacts. This directory is managed by the
orchestrator and must not be manually edited during automated execution.

Then describe the directory structure as an indented code block showing the tree:

```
.kw/
  plans/
    claude_plan.md         — Claude planner output
    codex_plan.md          — Codex planner output
    debate_resolution.md   — Debater agent output
    phase_plan.md          — Phase-scoped synthesized plan
  prompts/
    task_01.md             — Per-task Codex prompt (one file per task)
    task_NN.md             — (numbered sequentially, zero-padded to 2 digits)
    manifest.md            — Ordered list of all task prompts with summaries
  reviews/
    fix_round_1.md         — QA review output, round 1
    fix_round_N.md         — (numbered sequentially)
  outputs/
    task_01_output.md      — Captured Codex output for task 01
    task_01_error.md       — Captured Codex error output for task 01 (if any)
    task_NN_output.md      — (numbered matching task prompts)
  validation/
    report.md              — End-to-end validation results
    missing_credentials.md — Environment variables or secrets that were absent
```

After the code block, write a bulleted list of three operational rules for the
`.kw/` directory:

- All paths shown above are relative to the project root. The orchestrator uses
  absolute paths when invoking Codex.
- Do not delete `.kw/` directory contents between phases. The full artifact trail
  is preserved for debugging and audit purposes.
- If a file listed above does not exist yet (e.g. `debate_resolution.md` when debate
  was skipped), the orchestrator treats it as absent and proceeds without error.

---

#### Section 7 — `## Development Guidelines`

Write this section as a numbered list of six rules that apply to all code produced
during Stage 3 execution:

1. **Write clean, working code** — No placeholders, no TODOs, no `// implement later`
   comments. Every task prompt must produce complete, functional code. If a task
   cannot be completed without information that is not yet available, the Codex agent
   must return a clear error to the orchestrator rather than writing stub code.

2. **Follow existing project conventions** — Before writing any code, read the
   relevant existing source files to understand naming conventions, error handling
   patterns, module format (CommonJS vs ESM), and test structure. Do not introduce
   inconsistencies.

3. **Test everything** — Every function that can be tested must have tests. Acceptance
   criteria in task prompts must include at least one deterministically verifiable
   check (a command that can be run to confirm correctness). Tests must pass before
   a task is considered complete.

4. **Commit early and often** — Commit after each task completes, not only at phase
   end. Use descriptive commit messages that identify the phase and task number.
   Example: `kw: phase-02 task-03 — implement rate limiter middleware`.

5. **Handle errors explicitly** — Never swallow errors silently. Every error path
   must either propagate the error to the caller, log it with context, or return a
   structured error value. Code that catches errors and does nothing is not acceptable.

6. **When in doubt, ask the operator** — If a Codex agent produces output that is
   ambiguous, incomplete, or contradicts the phase plan, the orchestrator must pause
   and ask the operator before proceeding. Automated execution must not make
   architectural decisions that were not covered in the master plan.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The file `/DEV/kilntwo/assets/protocol.md` exists after you write it.

2. The file begins with `# KilnTwo Orchestration Protocol` as the first line
   (no frontmatter, no HTML comments, no blank lines before the heading).

3. The file contains exactly these seven top-level headings in order:
   - `# KilnTwo Orchestration Protocol`
   - `## Pipeline Stages`
   - `## Orchestration Rules`
   - `## Codex CLI Reference`
   - `## Memory Structure`
   - `## Working Directory Structure`
   - `## Development Guidelines`

4. `## Pipeline Stages` contains five numbered items with bold titles that
   include "Stage 1", "Stage 2", "Stage 3", "Stage 4", and "Stage 5".

5. `## Orchestration Rules` contains exactly nine numbered rules. Each rule
   has a bold name followed by a colon.

6. `## Codex CLI Reference` contains two fenced bash code blocks: one using
   `gpt-5.2` and one using `gpt-5.3-codex`. Both include `--skip-git-repo-check`.

7. The `gpt-5.3-codex` code block uses `--full-auto` and pipe input (`cat ... | codex ... -`).

8. `## Memory Structure` describes all five memory files: `MEMORY.md`,
   `vision.md`, `master-plan.md`, `decisions.md`, and `pitfalls.md`.

9. `## Working Directory Structure` contains a fenced code block showing the
   `.kw/` tree including all five subdirectories: `plans/`, `prompts/`,
   `reviews/`, `outputs/`, and `validation/`.

10. `## Development Guidelines` contains six numbered rules. Rule 1 explicitly
    prohibits placeholders and TODOs.

11. The file does not contain any of the text `<!-- kilntwo:protocol:begin`,
    `<!-- kilntwo:protocol:end`, or YAML frontmatter (`---` on its own line).

12. The file contains no placeholder text, TODO comments, or `[...]`-style
    blanks indicating incomplete content.

13. The file ends with exactly one trailing newline.

14. No line in the file contains trailing whitespace.

### Important

- This file is pure Markdown content — no YAML frontmatter, no HTML comment markers.
  The install system (`src/markers.js`) wraps this content between
  `<!-- kilntwo:protocol:begin vX.Y.Z -->` and `<!-- kilntwo:protocol:end -->`
  automatically. Do not add those markers yourself.
- Write complete, authoritative content — no hedging, no "fill this in later"
  sections, no stub paragraphs.
- The audience for this file is a Claude Code model acting as the KilnTwo
  orchestrator. Write in clear, imperative prose. Every rule must be unambiguous
  enough that a language model can follow it without interpretation.
- Do not create any other files. Do not modify any existing files in the repository.
- Do not install any packages or run any commands.
